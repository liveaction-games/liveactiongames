      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>Live Action Games is a small studio run by Kyle. We make puzzle and casual mobile games, including Sudoku Daily.</p>

      <h2>Data we collect</h2>
      <p><strong>In-app data (stored on your device only)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Game progress, statistics, and preferences (e.g. difficulty, theme)</li>
        <li>Purchase state for the "Go Ad-Free" subscription (stored locally to honor your choice)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data stays on your device and is not sent to our servers.</p>
      <p><strong>Advertising (AdMob)</strong></p>
      <p>Sudoku Daily uses Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect data for ad serving and analytics. Google's privacy policy applies to that data: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

      <h2>How we use data</h2>
      <p>We use in-app data to run the app (progress, settings) and to honor your "Go Ad-Free" purchase. We use AdMob to show ads when you have not purchased ad-free. We do not sell your personal data.</p>
